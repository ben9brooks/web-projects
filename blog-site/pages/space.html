        <p>Let's start with a quote from Michael Singer<sup>[1]</sup>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          To get some distance from this, you first need to get some
          perspective. Walk outside on a clear night and just look up into the
          sky. You are sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of
          absolutely nowhere. Though you can only see a few thousand stars,
          there are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone.
          In fact, it is estimated that there are over a trillion stars in the
          Spiral Galaxy. And that galaxy would look like one star to us, if we
          could even see it. You're just standing on one little ball of dirt and
          spinning around one of the stars. From that perspective, do you really
          care what people think about your clothes or your car? Do you really
          need to feel embarrassed if you forget someone's name? How can you let
          these meaning things cause pain? If you want out, if you want a decent
          life, you had better not devote your life to avoiding psychological
          pain. You had better not spend your life worrying about whether people
          like you or whether you car impresses people. What kind of life is
          that? It is a life of pain. You may not think that you feel pain that
          often, but you really do. To spend your life avoiding pain means it's
          always right behind you. At any point you could slip and say the wrong
          thing. At any point anything can happen. So you end up devoting your
          life to the avoidance of pain.
        </blockquote>

          We often focus on trying to change people's minds, or making sure our
          plans go accordingly. The unfortunate truth, though, is that we often
          are trying to change what is beyond our control. Why worry about what
          is beyond our reach? It will <em>always</em> figure itself out. To
          have an idea of how events should go is to set yourself up for
          failure, because it is impossible to ensure that it goes your way.
          It's best to let these thoughts go. How do we do that, you may ask?
          Well, you can read more about that on my other blog post
